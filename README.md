# Credit Card Checker (*Codecademy Project*)

The aim of this project was to take mystery credit card numbers and, with the use of certain functions, work out if they were valid or invalid.

## Features
When reviewing a batch of credit card numbers the project returns an array of the invalid credit card numbers and also which of the limited banks provided these invalid cards (based on the first number of the credit card).

### Technologies
The whole project was built within a single **JavaScript** file
